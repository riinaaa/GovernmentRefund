# Government Refund System

## **What is it?**
The GR system is a web-based system that helps employees to keep track of the ticket refunding process. 
It will have 3 users with different roles and will flow as follows: 
#### **•	Sales Office:**
Create new request, add the tickets numbers.
Then GR system will validate those tickets based on: 
###### o	Date of issuance
###### o	Coupon Status
###### o	Form Of Payment
Sales office can not add the requests if one of the tickets is not valid.
#### **•	Pax& Sales Audit:** 
Complete the requests by adding: Account Number (to refund the amount to it), Original ticket, Tax, and Sundry charges. At the end, the Pax team will either approve or reject the request.
#### **•	Collection Team:**
Can only view the requests and generate report with all the requests they need to refund (still manually).
